Malicious Web Sites Detection and Prevention

ABSTRACT 

Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and, indirectly, money ), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication ~ Wikipedia
Leading web portals get trapped because of phishing attacks each day. Thousands of passwords are stolen without either the users or the portals knowing about it, sometimes users also lose money from their bank accounts. Companies end up paying a lot of money in the courts to deal with such attacks

PROJECT APPROACH

Solution for users and clients by using machine learning to detect phishing sites and notify them. Use Pyspark to gather data sets and to apply algorithm over large datasets. 
Some of the modules that we are going to be using:
Whois API (or something similar), to fetch the domain info, reputation score, etc.
HTML parsing library to detect form fields and POST destination.
SendPulse / Twilio, to notify users/clients about possible phishing attack.
